# Chatbot Intent Classifier - Data Preprocessing

This repository focuses on data preprocessing for a chatbot's intent classification task. The goal is to transform raw text data into a format suitable for machine learning models, particularly neural networks.

## Structure

The data is structured as intents, each having:
- A tag (representing the intent's name).
- Patterns (example phrases/sentences that fit this intent).
- Responses (sample replies the chatbot might give for this intent).

For example:

```json
{
    "tag": "greeting",
    "patterns": ["Hi", "How are you", "Hello"],
    "responses": ["Hello, thanks for visiting", "Hi there, how can I help?"]
}
```

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing involves several steps:

1. **Tokenization and Stemming**: Each pattern is broken down into words, and each word is stemmed to its base form.
2. **Bag-of-words Representation**: Patterns are transformed into a binary list representing the presence or absence of each word from the entire vocabulary in that pattern.
3. **One-hot Encoding**: Each intent tag is represented as a one-hot encoded vector.

## Error in the Code

The current codebase may have an issue when converting the training data into a numpy array due to inconsistent inner list lengths. It's recommended to keep the training data as lists or ensure all inner lists have a consistent length.

## Potential Next Steps

- Define a neural network model (e.g., MLP) to train on the preprocessed data.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance on a test set.
- Integrate the trained model into a chatbot system to classify user input and produce appropriate responses.
